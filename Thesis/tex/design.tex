\chapter{Research Design \& Application}
\label{ch:design}
As discussed in the literature review this research has a focus on the negotiation of the agents. Using different methods and techniques an attempt is made to optimize a production process. We search to find an approximate-optimal solution while the optimal solution is unknown to the group. %Based on learning methods from decentralized holonistic methods, utility and negotation domains a simulation can be build which can be applied to the production process. 

The system where the  decentralized solution will be applied is a de-mineralized water plant as described in the introduction and problem chapters (\cref{ch:intro}).

As explained in the literature, a negotiation problem can be characterized by a negotiation domain (who negotiates and what to negotiate about), an interaction protocol (which rules govern the negotiation process) and a set of decision mechanisms or strategies that guide the negotiating agents through every phase of the interaction protocol \cite{fatima2014principles}.

For the scope of this work, we assume a multi-attribute negotiation domain, where a deal or solution to the problem is defined as the set of attributes (issues), and each one of them can be in a certain range.

The coding will be done in Java from scratch. Multiple open-source systems area available, including Jadex, which is perfect for communication research in a Multi-Agent System~\cite{kravari2015survey}. However since most of these systems are very comprehensive little adjustments which are necessary for our research are not conceivable.

\section{Demineralization of water}
As discussed in the introduction, the usecase where an Multi-Agent system for production will be implemented is a water demineralization plant. An application of this new model will be applied to a large plants that creates de-mineralized water. By removing all the ions from common water, de-mineralized water is obtained. This water is used for many processes, and has many applications. In this plant specifically it is used for the steam turbines, which generate electricity. By burning the by-product, heat is generated, which creates steam to power the turbines. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/demi-plant}
	\caption{An overview of a water demineralization plant.}
	\label{fig:demi-plant}
\end{figure}

Minerals are removed from water by multiple production steps. Most common, and as is implemented in the plant described, is to first remove the positively charged minerals in so called anions. After this the negative charged ions are removed with in a cation filter. To ensure all ions are removed, a final combined ``mixbed'' is used. Here a combination of an anion and cation filter removes the residues.

These filters have to be cleaned every few hours to ensure proper demineralization occurs. For cleaning acid and base are used. By filtering the anion with base the ions that have been retrieved in the filtering are flushed. The residue, still of a base composition, is stored in a storage tank where the combination of the base and acids from the filters is neutralized. This storage tank is called the ''Neut`` as short.

So overall we have 4 kinds of filters, the anions, the cations, the mixbed and the Neut. Each of these filters sorts have multiple of each other, but for simplification we only look at the allocation of resources for these four ''agents``. Within each agent the right resources amount will be allocated. This will be done with negotiation and combined with the information that is retrieved from the experts knowledge.


\section{Negotiation model}

\todo{RubinStein!!1}
These 4 rational agents, $M = \{1,2,3, 4\}$, partition 3 issues $N=\{1,2,3\}$: the water that has to be delivered at the end of the process, and the base and acid for cleaning.  This can be simplified to a buyer seller negotiation.

Anion wants to buy as much base as possible, while the minimum amount of water. For the cation, as much acid as possible is required, while still as little water as possible should be produced. The mixbed requires as much as possible acid and base for cleaning. Since it the final production step, it requires the water to be delivered, forcing it to obtain as much water as possible from the cation. Finally there is the Neut which wants as little base and acid as possible. Also the base and acid should be levelled out as much as possible to attempt to stay as close to a pH of $7$. 

The above abstractly is translated to an unit interval $[0, 1]$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Since we have $3$ issues, the unit hypercube $[0, 1]^3$ in  $\mathbb{R}^3$. This results in a possible negotiation domain $\Omega = [0,1]$ per issue.

The utility function for each agent $u_i(x)$ is convex, and normalized between $[0, 1]^3$. Each agent has a reservation utility $ru_i$. Any offer below this reservation utility is unacceptrable. This means that the set of feasible offers is $A = \{ x\in [0,1]^3 \mid u_i(x)\geq ru_i\}$. Since the function is convex, $A$ is also. The solution lies in the intersection of feasible offers, $\mathbb{Z} \cap^M_{i=1}A^i$.

The protocol used is that of the alternating offer protocol as described in \cref{sec:negotiation}. The agent will propose in a fixed sequence, where the new offer is based on all previous offers given in the previous round. If all agents accept an current offer the negotiation ends. The overall protocol is based on \citet{zheng2015automated}. 
	%The protocol is based on the method as proposed by \citet{wu2009efficient}. Here an multilateral multi-issue method for negotiation about the allocation of resources is given. 

%Since the agents have no knowledge regarding the states of the other agents, 
It is a difficult task to determine whether the solution is a proper one, since the agents only have knowledge of their own utility function which is private. 

The negotiation takes place in rounds $n\in \mathbb{N} $. $\mathbf{x}_i \in (0,1)^3$ denotes a bid of agent $i \in N$ in a round and $x_{i,j}\in \mathbf{x}_i$  denote the amount of issue $j \in M$.

%Using BDI in each agent, the anion will know which filter to use when, and when to clean them. This intelligence can be learned. There is a limit on the amount of water, base or acid.

%Head tries to increase the holon utility as a whole, and this does not contradict the increase in body-agent utility. In other words, Head wants to increase holonâ€™s utility, and is willing to do this according to body-agent preference.

\section{Details of the Agents}
Each agent has its own characteristics on which the system will run. As shown in the introduction the agents gave difference preferences regarding the allocation of the resources. An offer has a different utility for each agent. 

When the negotiations start, each agent will attempt to obtain as much utility as possible. Thus, when negotiations start, they propose the offer with the highest utility for them. During the negotiation, the required utility slowly decreases. This is a monotonically decreasing function of t. The concession strategy $s$, is agent dependent. However, this utility will always be larger than the agents minimum utility, or reservation curve: $s_i(t) \geq tu_i\forall t$.

Since the utility decreases each round, the set of feasible offers increases as well. This means that at time $t$, agent $i$ has the convex set $A^i_t = \{x\in [0,1]^3 \mid u_i(x) \geq s_i(t)   \}$ as possible offers. Since $s_i(t)$ is monotonically decreasing, this means that $\forall t, A^i_1\subseteq A^i_2 \subseteq ... \subseteq A^i$ .

\subsubsection{Offer generation}
When an agent $i$ has offered $x\in[0,1]^3$, the next agent $j$ will either accept the offer $x^i_t$, or create a new offer $x^I_{t+1}$. 

To create the new offer, the agent will project offer $x^i_t$ on the border of its feasible offer set $A^i_t$. This boundary, or indifference curve, is the set of points for which the utility is equal to agent $j$. The projection can be done using convex projection techniques as explained in \citet{boyd2004convex}. In this method, a linear indifference curve will always be obtained making convex projection calculations unnecessary. This has been done to ensure an high speed run time, since the state of the world will change quickly.


%The basis consists of the different sub agents. The head agent will know the state of the sub agents and will negotation on heave of the entire group. 

%Important to note is that the utility function is required to be convex. 
\subsection{Anion}
The anion is the first filter where the untreated water will arrive. It needs base to clean the filters after water has been produced. The water that is produced by the anion filter will flow to the cation filter. The anion and cation filter both have a low interest in the production of water, and thus do not need to negotiate which each other.%The filters have different characteristics and it is the job of the head to decide on the filters task. Some will be paused, some will filter, and others will be cleaned. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/Anion_utility}
	\caption{The utility function for the Anion.}
	\label{fig:anionutility}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Utility function}
%As described in \citet{wong2010multi}, it is possible by combining the input into the utiltiy function of the agent. This is shown in \cref{fig:wongutiltiyneuralnetwork}. 
The utility function for the anion filter is set up as follows:

\[
\text{Anion utility} = \frac{e^{-W+B}}{e^1}
\]
where W is water ([0,1]) and B is base [0,1]. The division by $e$ is done to ensure normalization. The utility is [0,1]. It is visualized in \cref{fig:anionutility}.

This function has been obtained after talks with industry experts. They confirmed that a high base wish, and low water wish is in line with the anions utility. A consequence of this function is that it can be expressed as $ (\ln(u)+1) = -W+B$. This means that if the required utility is known, an indifference line is the result. As visualized in \cref{fig:anionutilitycontour}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/Anion_utility_contour}
	\caption{The visualization of of the indifference curves for the Anion agent.}
	\label{fig:anionutilitycontour}
\end{figure}

The reservation curve, has been set as the curve where the utility $= 0.3$. This means that any offer on the line $0 = B - W - (\ln(0.3)+1)$ is acceptable in the final stages of negotiation.

%At first a simple linear utiltiy function will be used: the less water, the higher the utility. Also, the more base, the higher the utility. This has a limit, depending on the reservation function as shown in \cref{fig:anionreservationfunction}.

If the indifference line is know, a projection on this line is possible. 
At $t$, the agent $i$ (anion) has the required utility $s^i_t$. Suppose $s^i_t = 0.4$ This means that there is an indifference curve $0 = B - W - (\ln(0.4)+1)$. Suppose offer $x(t-1)$ contains an offer for base 0.4 and water 0.7 (we can disregard the acid offer in this example since the anion has an indifference for the amount of acid used). 

A projection to the indifference curve of the Anion is achieved with the following formulae. Given the information above, $x_0 = 0.4 \text{ and } y_0 = 0.7$. Furthermore, $\texttt{a} x + \texttt{b} y + \texttt{c} = 0$, $\texttt{a} = 1, \texttt{b} = -1, \texttt{c} = -(\ln(0.4)+1)$

\[(ax+by+c=0, (x_0, y_0)) = \frac{|ax_0+by_0+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}. \]

\[x = \frac{b(bx_0 - ay_0)-ac}{a^2 + b^2} \text{ and } y = \frac{a(-bx_0 + ay_0) - bc}{a^2+b^2}\]

The above is visualized in \cref{fig:projectionanionexample}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/projection_anion_example}
	\caption{Example of the projection of a point to the indifference curve for an Anion. The utility here is 0.4, and the offer is base = 0.4; water = 0.7.}
	\label{fig:projectionanionexample}
\end{figure}

%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/wong_utiltiy_NeuralNetwork}
%	\caption{An example where the utility function is modelled with a Neural Network. \citep{wong2010multi}.}
%	\label{fig:wongutiltiyneuralnetwork}
%\end{figure}



%A very important input to the utility function is that of the belief in the other agents. These will not be formally modelled, as in Kripke worlds e.g., but can still be used as input to the utility function. 

\subsection{Cation}
The cation is the second aspect of the water cleaning process and where the positively charged ions are removed. It cleans itself with acid. %A overview of the filter is shown in \cref{fig:cation-head-sub}.

The utility is very similar to that of the Anion but a preference over acid instead of base is required. This results in the function:
\[
\text{Cation utility} = \frac{e^{-W+A}}{e^1}
\] 
where W is water ([0,1]) and A is acid [0,1].

The reservation curve for the Cation is very similar to that of the Anion. Only difference lies in the requirement for acid instead of base. It been set as the curve where the utility $= 0.3$. This means that any offer on the line $0 = B - W - (\ln(0.3)+1)$ is acceptable.

\subsection{Neut}
The neut is the agent responsible for the allocation of the amount of Acid and base. Since it wants to stay as pH neutral as possible, it requires an even distribution of base and acid between the agents. This is not achieved in the utility function which is the same as the others, just different variables.

\[
\text{neut utility} = \frac{e^{-A-B}}{e^3}
\] 
where B is base [0,1] and A is acid [0,1].

The reservation curve however is a little different. It consist of two functions, $0 \geq -B - A - 0.2 \text{ and }  0 \leq -B - A + 0.2$. The value of $0.2$ has been decided on after talks with experts. 


\subsection{Mixbed}

The mixbed is where the final cleaning occurs. It is also the agent responsible for the end water delivery. Since it consists of a mixture off anion and base it has three issues it desires. This is realized with the function below:
\[
\text{mixbed utility} = \frac{e^{W+A+B}}{e^3}
\] 
where W is water ([0,1]), B is base [0,1] and A is acid [0,1].

The reservation curve is given as $0 = A+B+W - (\ln(u)+3)  $. The projection of a point to this linear plane is calculated as follows:
\[
x = \frac{x_0 + (\ln(u)+3) - (x_0, y_0, z_0)}{3}
\]

\[
y = \frac{y_0 + (\ln(u)+3) - (x_0, y_0, z_0)}{3} 
\]

\[
z = \frac{z_0 + (\ln(u)+3) - (x_0, y_0, z_0)}{3}
\]

%These are shown in \cref{fig:mixreservationfunction1, fig:mixreservationfunction2}.
\subsection{Negotiations}
All in all there are three kinds of sub-negotiations. These are shown in \cref{fig:agent-plant-base,,fig:agent-plant-acid,,fig:agent-plant-water}. To visualize the workings of these the solution space is shown in \
